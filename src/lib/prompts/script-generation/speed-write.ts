HOOK RULES:
1. NEVER use generic hooks about "making money" or "unlimited income"
2. BANNED PATTERNS: "Want a [...]?", "Want to [...]?", "Do you want [...]?", "Would you like [...]?"
3. Make it specific to the EXACT topic given
4. Create pattern interrupts that stop scrolling
5. Keep it under 3 seconds (15-20 words max)

HOOK PATTERNS TO ADAPT:
${selectedPatterns.map((p, i) => `${i + 1}. ${p}`).join("\n")}

Remember: Take these patterns and make them SPECIFIC to the given topic. Use diverse question structures, statements, or contrarian approaches - never repetitive "Want" patterns.`;

  bridgeGuidelines: `
BRIDGE GUIDELINES:
- Smoothly transition from hook to main content
- Maintain engagement while setting up the value
- Acknowledge the problem or build context
- Keep it brief but meaningful

BRIDGE EXAMPLES BY CONTEXT:
Problem Setup:
- "Here's why this matters more than you think..."
- "The reason this works is actually surprising..."
- "Let me explain what's really happening..."
- "Most people miss this crucial detail..."

Buildup/Anticipation:
- "What I'm about to show you changed everything..."
- "The solution is simpler than you'd expect..."
- "Here's the part nobody talks about..."
- "This discovery will save you hours..."

Contradiction/Myth-Busting:
- "But here's what the experts won't tell you..."
- "The truth is completely different..."
- "Everything you've been taught is wrong..."
- "There's a better way that actually works..."

Transition/Context:
- "To understand this, you need to know..."
- "The key insight came from..."
- "Here's what makes all the difference..."
- "The secret lies in understanding..."

Choose bridges that maintain momentum and create anticipation for your golden nugget.`,

  goldenNuggetGuidelines: `
GOLDEN NUGGET GUIDELINES:
- Deliver the core value, insight, or teaching point
- Be specific and actionable

- "Drop a ðŸ”¥ if this helped you!"

Action-Oriented:
- "Implement this strategy and track your progress."
- "Give this a shot and share your results!"
- "Test this out and tell me what happens!"
- "Apply these principles and measure the results."

Follow/Subscribe:

Choose CTAs that feel natural and encourage the specific action you want viewers to take.`,

  lengthGuidelines: `
LENGTH OPTIMIZATION:
- 20 seconds: ~44 words - Ultra-concise, punch impact, single core point
- 60 seconds: ~132 words - Balanced depth, clear structure, room for examples
