*Camera opens on messy bedroom*

"Okay, so 6 months ago I was a complete disaster..."

*Quick montage of old messy habits*

"But then I discovered this ONE thing that changed everything."

*Dramatic pause*

"I started making my bed. That's it."

*Show perfectly made bed*

"It sounds simple, but here's why it works..."

*Cut to talking head explaining the psychology*

"When you accomplish something first thing in the morning, it sets the tone for your entire day."

*Show more organized life*

"Try it for 7 days and watch your life transform. Who's in?"`
