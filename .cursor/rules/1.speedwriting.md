Speed Writing Workflow Analysis
User Journey: Script Creation Process
When a user clicks on /dashboard/scripts/new and inputs a content idea, here's the complete workflow:

1. Frontend Entry Point
   File: src/app/(main)/dashboard/scripts/new/page.tsx
   Purpose: Main script creation page
   Key Features:
   Input mode toggle (text vs video URL)
   Script length selection (20, 60, 90 seconds)
   Integration with Ghost Writer for idea suggestions
   Voice selection display
   Error handling and loading states
2. Input Processing
   File: src/app/(main)/dashboard/scripts/new/\_components/input-mode-toggle.tsx
   Purpose: Handles user input (text idea or video URL)
   Key Features:
   URL validation for TikTok, Instagram, YouTube
   Keyboard shortcuts (⌘+Enter)
   Platform detection and validation
   Idea inbox integration
3. API Call to Speed Write Service
   File: src/app/api/script/speed-write/route.ts
   Purpose: Main API endpoint for script generation
   Workflow:
   Authentication: Uses src/lib/api-key-auth.ts for user verification
   Rate Limiting: Checks user's API usage limits
   Credit Check: Uses src/lib/credits-service.ts to verify user has enough credits
   Parallel Processing: Generates multiple script options simultaneously
4. Script Generation Process
   A. Speed Write Script Generation
   Function: generateSpeedWriteScript()
   Uses: src/lib/prompt-helpers.ts → createSpeedWritePrompt()
   AI Service: src/lib/gemini.ts → GeminiService.generateContent()
   Output: Structured JSON with hook, bridge, golden nugget, WTA sections
   B. Educational Script Generation
   Function: generateEducationalScript()
   Purpose: Alternative script approach for educational content
   Uses: Different prompt structure for educational content
   C. AI Voice Script Generation
   Function: generateAIVoiceScript()
   Uses: src/lib/voice-template-processor.ts
   Purpose: Generates scripts using user's custom voice templates
   Integration: Fetches active voice from src/lib/ai-voices-service.ts
5. Supporting Services
   Authentication & Authorization
   File: src/lib/api-key-auth.ts
   Purpose: Validates API keys, handles rate limiting, user authentication
   Features: Rate limiting, violation tracking, lockout periods
   Credit Management
   File: src/lib/credits-service.ts
   Purpose: Manages user credits for script generation
   Features: Credit deduction, usage tracking, account level limits
   AI Integration
   File: src/lib/gemini.ts
   Purpose: Google Gemini AI service integration
   Features: Content generation, audio transcription, retry logic
   Content Processing
   File: src/lib/json-extractor.ts
   Purpose: Extracts structured JSON from AI responses
   Features: Robust parsing, error handling, fallback mechanisms
   Script Validation
   File: src/lib/script-validation.ts
   Purpose: Validates generated scripts for quality
   Features: Placeholder detection, content cleaning, validation rules
   Negative Keywords
   File: src/lib/negative-keywords-service.ts
   Purpose: Filters out unwanted content from scripts
   Features: User-customizable keyword lists, default filters
   Usage Tracking
   File: src/lib/usage-tracker-admin.ts
   Purpose: Tracks API usage for analytics and billing
   Features: Token counting, response time tracking, cost calculation
6. Response Processing
   File: src/app/api/script/speed-write/route.ts (continued)
   Process:
   Combines results from parallel generation
   Creates script options (Option A & B)
   Validates final output
   Deducts credits for successful generation
   Tracks usage statistics
   Returns structured response
7. Frontend Response Handling
   File: src/app/(main)/dashboard/scripts/new/page.tsx (continued)
   Process:
   Receives API response
   Stores results in session storage
   Navigates to script editor with parameters
   Triggers usage stats update
8. Script Editor Integration
   File: src/app/(main)/dashboard/scripts/editor/page.tsx
   Purpose: Displays generated script options
   Process:
   Loads speed-write results from session storage
   Shows script options to user
   Allows user to select preferred script
   Transitions to editing mode
9. Ghost Writer Integration
   File: src/components/ghost-writer.tsx
   Purpose: Provides AI-generated content ideas
   Integration: Can pre-fill script creation form with suggested ideas
   API: Uses /api/ghost-writer/enhanced for idea generation
   Key Supporting Files:
   Types & Interfaces:
   src/types/ai-voices.ts - AI voice definitions
   src/types/ghost-writer.ts - Ghost writer data structures
   src/types/usage-tracking.ts - Usage tracking types
   Data Sources:
   src/data/negative-keywords.ts - Default negative keywords
   src/data/sample-voices.ts - Sample voice templates
   Context Providers:
   src/contexts/auth-context.tsx - User authentication state
   src/contexts/usage-context.tsx - Usage statistics
   src/contexts/voice-context.tsx - Voice selection state
   Workflow Summary:
   User Input → Text idea or video URL
   Authentication → API key validation + rate limiting
   Credit Check → Verify user has sufficient credits
   Parallel Generation → Speed write + Educational + AI Voice scripts
   Content Processing → JSON extraction + validation + cleaning
   Response Assembly → Create script options A & B
   Credit Deduction → Track usage and deduct credits
   Frontend Display → Show options in script editor
   User Selection → Choose preferred script for editing
   This workflow demonstrates a sophisticated, production-ready system with proper error handling, rate limiting, credit management, and multiple AI generation approaches running in parallel.
