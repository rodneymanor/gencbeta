Video URL Workflow Analysis
Current Implementation Status: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED
1. Frontend Entry Point (COMPLETE)
File: src/app/(main)/dashboard/scripts/new/page.tsx
Purpose: Handles video URL input and navigation
Workflow:
User selects "Video URL" tab in InputModeToggle
User enters TikTok/Instagram URL
URL validation occurs in InputModeToggle
On submit, navigates to script editor with video URL parameters
2. URL Validation (COMPLETE)
File: src/app/(main)/dashboard/scripts/new/_components/input-mode-toggle.tsx
Purpose: Validates video URLs and detects platforms
Features:
Platform detection (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube)
URL validation with error messages
YouTube marked as "coming soon"
Only TikTok and Instagram currently supported
3. Navigation to Script Editor (COMPLETE)
File: src/app/(main)/dashboard/scripts/new/page.tsx (lines 165-184)

;
4. Script Editor (INCOMPLETE)
File: src/app/(main)/dashboard/scripts/editor/page.tsx
Issue: The script editor does NOT handle video URL parameters
Current behavior: Only handles speed-write results from session storage
Missing: Video URL processing workflow
5. Video Processing Components (EXIST BUT UNUSED)
File: src/app/(main)/dashboard/scripts/editor/_components/video-processor.tsx
Purpose: Video processing UI component
Features:
Progress tracking for download and transcription
Error handling and retry functionality
Platform detection display
Status: Component exists but is not integrated into the script editor
File: src/app/(main)/dashboard/scripts/editor/_components/types.ts
Purpose: Video processing utilities
Functions:
processVideoUrl() - Downloads and transcribes video
detectPlatform() - Platform detection
transcribeFromBuffer() - Transcription helper
6. Backend API Routes (COMPLETE)
File: src/app/api/video/downloader/route.ts
Purpose: Downloads videos from TikTok/Instagram
Features:
Platform detection
Video download with metadata
Error handling
File: src/app/api/video/transcribe/route.ts
Purpose: Transcribes video content
Features:
Supports both file upload and URL transcription
Uses Gemini AI for transcription
Error handling and validation
7. Supporting Services (COMPLETE)
File: src/lib/video-processing-helpers.ts
Purpose: Video processing utilities
Features:
Platform-specific download functions
TikTok and Instagram video extraction
Metadata collection
File: src/lib/tiktok-downloader.ts
Purpose: TikTok-specific video downloading
Features:
Video ID extraction
Metadata collection
Caching mechanisms
Missing Integration Points
Critical Gap: Script Editor Video Processing
The script editor page (src/app/(main)/dashboard/scripts/editor/page.tsx) is missing the video URL handling logic. It should:
Check for video URL parameters in searchParams
Initialize video processing when video URL is present
Display the VideoProcessor component during processing
Handle transcript results and generate scripts
Show script options after processing
Proposed Integration
The script editor should include something like:

Current Workflow Summary
What Works:
✅ User can input video URL
✅ URL validation and platform detection
✅ Navigation to script editor with parameters
✅ Backend video download and transcription APIs
✅ Video processing UI components exist
What's Missing:
❌ Script editor doesn't handle video URL parameters
❌ Video processing workflow not integrated
❌ No automatic script generation from video transcripts
❌ VideoProcessor component not used in script editor
Files Involved in Current State:
Frontend: src/app/(main)/dashboard/scripts/new/page.tsx (navigation)
Validation: src/app/(main)/dashboard/scripts/new/_components/input-mode-toggle.tsx
Backend APIs: src/app/api/video/downloader/route.ts, src/app/api/video/transcribe/route.ts
Processing Utils: src/lib/video-processing-helpers.ts, src/lib/tiktok-downloader.ts
Unused Components: src/app/(main)/dashboard/scripts/editor/_components/video-processor.tsx
The video URL workflow is architecturally complete but functionally incomplete due to the missing integration in the script editor page.
