# Performance Optimization Rules

## General Performance Rules
- Use const assertions for immutable arrays and objects
- Prefer early returns to reduce nesting levels
- Use object destructuring instead of repeated property access
- Implement proper memoization for expensive calculations

## React Performance Optimizations
- Use React.memo for components with stable props
- Implement proper dependency arrays in hooks
- Use useCallback and useMemo appropriately
- Avoid creating objects and functions in render methods
