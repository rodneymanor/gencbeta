# React Quality Rules

## React Best Practices
- Always use React.Fragment or <> </> instead of unnecessary div wrappers
- Define prop types using TypeScript interfaces, not PropTypes
- Use useCallback for functions passed as props to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Use useMemo for expensive calculations
- Always include dependency arrays for useEffect hooks

## JSX Rules
- Use self-closing tags for components without children
- Prefer ternary operators over && for conditional rendering when falsy values matter
- Extract complex JSX into separate components when it exceeds 10 lines
