# Learning and Adaptation Rules

## Progressive Rule Development
1. After fixing a lint error manually, add a rule explaining the fix
2. Include the reasoning behind the fix in comments
3. Update rules when patterns change or new best practices emerge
4. Review and refine rules monthly based on recurring issues

## Rule Priority System
- Critical: Rules that prevent runtime errors or security issues
- Important: Rules that improve code maintainability and readability
- Preference: Rules that enforce team coding style preferences
