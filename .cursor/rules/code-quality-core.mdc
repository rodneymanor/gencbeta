# Core Code Quality Rules

## Import Organization and Style
- Always organize imports alphabetically within groups (external, internal, relative)
- Use single quotes for strings unless they contain single quotes
- Add trailing commas in multiline arrays and objects
- Use 2 spaces for indentation consistently

## Variable Naming Conventions
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for classes and components
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Prefix boolean variables with "is", "has", "can", or "should"

## Common Lint Error Fixes
- When fixing "no-unused-vars" errors, create a rule to avoid declaring unused variables
- When fixing "no-console" errors, remind to use proper logging libraries in production
- When fixing "prefer-const" errors, always use const for variables that don't get reassigned
- When fixing "no-var" errors, always use let or const instead of var

## Prettier Formatting Patterns
- Apply automatic line breaks at 80-100 characters
- Always include trailing commas in multiline structures
- Maintain consistent semicolon usage based on project preference
