## Current Focus: Script Editor Chat Integration

### Recently Completed (December 2024)
ðŸŽ‰ **MAJOR MILESTONE: Script Creation Page Transformation Completed**

Successfully transformed `/dashboard/scripts/new` from multi-step workflow to Notion-style single-page interface.

#### âœ… Script Creation Interface (COMPLETED)

**What was built**: Complete redesign of script creation page with:

**Core Interface Components**:
- **Header Section**: "What will you Script today?" with descriptive subtitle
- **Main Input**: Large textarea with "My script ideas for the day is..." placeholder
- **Controls Row**: Idea Inbox button + Length selector (20s/60s/90s) + Submit arrow
- **Action Buttons**: Yolo Mode (selected by default), Hook Chooser, Influencer Tone, Template Chooser
- **Daily Ideas Section**: Personalized ideas grid with source badges + Magic Wand + Bookmark

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Modular Architecture**: Extracted components into separate files for maintainability
  - `_components/daily-idea-card.tsx` - Individual idea cards with hover interactions
  - `_components/idea-inbox-dialog.tsx` - Modal with saved voice/written notes
  - `_components/types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces and utility functions
- **Mock Data System**: Realistic daily ideas from 6 sources (problems, excuses, questions, Google Trends, Reddit, X)
- **State Management**: Clean React state for script idea, mode selection, length, and bookmark status
- **Navigation Integration**: Passes context to script editor via URL parameters
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: âŒ˜+Enter to submit for improved UX

**Key Features**:
- **Smart Source Detection**: Color-coded badges for different idea sources
- **Interactive Elements**: Magic wand navigation, bookmark toggles, hover states
- **Mode Selection**: Yolo Mode active, others marked "Coming Soon"
- **Length Controls**: Affects script generation (20s=no CTA, longer=full structure)
- **Responsive Design**: Grid layout adapts to mobile/tablet/desktop

### Current State

#### ðŸŽ¯ Next Priority: Script Editor Chat Integration

**Current Challenge**: The script editor page exists but lacks the chat functionality to process ideas from the new script creation interface.

**What needs to be built**:
1. **Chat Interface**: Add conversational UI to script editor page
2. **URL Parameter Processing**: Read idea, mode, length, source from URL params
3. **AI Integration**: Connect to script generation API based on mode and length
4. **Real-time Editing**: Allow users to refine scripts through chat
5. **Mode-Specific Behavior**: Different AI prompts based on Yolo/Hook/Influencer/Template selection

**Technical Requirements**:
- Parse URL parameters on script editor page load
- Create chat component with AI conversation flow
- Implement mode-specific prompt templates
- Add length-aware script generation
- Maintain existing editor functionality

**Success Metrics**:
- User can submit idea from new page â†’ auto-generate script in editor
- Chat interface allows script refinement
- Mode selection affects generation style
- Length controls influence script structure

### Recent Infrastructure Improvements
- âœ… Background transcription loop completed (videos auto-update with real analysis)
- âœ… Smart sidebar navigation system
- âœ… Global video playback management 
- âœ… Script creation interface transformation

### Architectural Notes

**Design System Adherence**: Following established patterns with proper spacing (4px grid), color schemes, and component reusability.

**Performance Optimizations**: Modular components reduce bundle size, extracted utilities prevent duplication.

**Future Extensions**: Ready for API integration to replace mock data with real personalized ideas from user's voice notes and saved content.
