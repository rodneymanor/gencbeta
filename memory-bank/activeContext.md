# Active Context: Production Video Collection System

## Current State: Fully Production Ready âœ…
The Gen C Beta application is live on Vercel with complete video processing functionality. All major video collection issues have been resolved, and the system is operating reliably in production with single video playback controls and enhanced UI features.

## ðŸŽ‰ **LATEST COMPLETION: Video Collection System Production Ready (Dec 30, 2024)**

### **Critical RBAC Fix - Videos Now Appear in Collections**
**Root Cause Resolved**: Videos were being saved without the `addedAt` timestamp field required by RBAC filtering queries.

**Solution Applied**:
- Added missing `addedAt` field to video save operation in `/api/video/process-and-add`
- Fixed Instagram URL encoding issues with proper decoding before regex matching
- Enhanced authentication to include `userId` field for proper ownership tracking
- All videos now appear immediately in collections after processing

### **Production-Ready Single Video Playback**
**Problem Solved**: Multiple videos were playing simultaneously when switching between them.

**Technical Solution - Iframe Recreation Strategy**:
- Complete iframe destruction and recreation when pausing videos
- `iframeKey` state increment forces React to unmount/remount iframes
- Conditional rendering for thumbnail vs playing states
- Bunny.net CDN URL validation - rejects all non-Bunny URLs
- Production-tested solution ensuring only one video plays at a time

### **Enhanced Script Editor - Expandable Text Feature**
**User Experience Improvement**: Long script ideas now have smart truncation.

**Implementation**:
- ExpandableText component with 3-line initial display
- "Show more/Show less" toggle with chevron icons
- Smart detection - only truncates content >3 lines or >300 characters
- Applied specifically to initial user messages (bubble ideas)
- Maintains clean chat interface without overwhelming long content

## **Production Deployment Status**
- **Live URL**: https://gencbeta-f38hbrvqe-rodneymanors-projects.vercel.app
- **Last Deployment**: December 30, 2024
- **Build Time**: ~55 seconds with full optimization
- **All Features**: Working correctly in production environment

## **Core System Overview**

### **Video Processing Pipeline**
âœ… **Complete Workflow**: URL â†’ Download â†’ Stream to Bunny CDN â†’ Add to collections â†’ Background transcription  
âœ… **Platform Support**: TikTok and Instagram with proper URL decoding  
âœ… **Real-time Updates**: Videos appear in collections with 1.5-second reliability delay  
âœ… **Background Processing**: Transcription completes automatically without user intervention  
âœ… **RBAC Compliance**: Proper user ownership tracking with `userId` and `addedAt` fields  

### **Video Playback System**
âœ… **Single Video Enforcement**: Only one video plays at a time across all collections  
âœ… **Bunny.net CDN Only**: Strict URL validation blocks direct social media URLs  
âœ… **Iframe Recreation**: Complete iframe lifecycle management for reliable playback control  
âœ… **Production Security**: CSP compliance by rejecting TikTok/Instagram direct embedding  
âœ… **User-Friendly Errors**: Clear messaging for unsupported video types  

### **User Experience Enhancements**
âœ… **Expandable Text**: Smart truncation for long script ideas in editor  
âœ… **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate video appearance with processing indicators  
âœ… **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive error handling with retry capabilities  
âœ… **Mobile Responsive**: Full functionality across all device types  

## **Recent Technical Achievements**

### **RBAC Video Query Fix**
```typescript
// Fixed: Videos now saved with required fields
await videoRef.set({
  ...videoData,
  collectionId,
  id: videoRef.id,
  addedAt: timestamp,      // âœ… Required by RBAC queries
  createdAt: timestamp,
  updatedAt: timestamp,
  userId: decodedToken.uid  // âœ… Proper ownership tracking
});
```

### **Single Video Playback Solution**
```typescript
// Production iframe recreation strategy
useEffect(() => {
  if (currentlyPlayingId !== videoId) {
    setIsPlaying(false);
    setIsLoading(false);
    // Force iframe to be completely destroyed and recreated
    setIframeKey((prev) => prev + 1);
  }
}, [currentlyPlayingId, videoId, isPlaying]);
```

### **Bunny.net URL Validation**
```typescript
// Strict security policy - Bunny.net only
const isBunnyUrl = url && (
  url.includes("iframe.mediadelivery.net") || 
  url.includes("bunnycdn.com") ||
  url.includes("b-cdn.net")
);
```

## **Speed Write A/B Generation System**

### **Current State: Production Ready**
âœ… **Complete Script Output**: Users get ready-to-record content  
âœ… **Two Distinct Approaches**: Speed Write vs Educational, both complete  
âœ… **Length-Appropriate**: Word counts match target video duration  
âœ… **Streamlined Navigation**: Scripting-first design with Poppins typography  
âœ… **Session Management**: Seamless transfer between pages  

### **Prompt Specifications**
**Speed Write Formula (Exact Structure)**:
- Hook: "If..." format (8-12 words)
- Simple actionable advice with clear steps
- Reasoning: "This is..." explanation
- Benefit: "So you don't..." outcome
- Grade 3 reading level, FaceTime conversational tone

**Educational Approach**:
- Complete instructional scripts with specific hooks
- Problem â†’ solution â†’ examples â†’ call to action structure
- Professional but conversational delivery

## **System Architecture Status**
