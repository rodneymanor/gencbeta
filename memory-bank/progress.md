### **System Status: Complete Credit-Based Platform** âœ…
Gen C Beta now features a comprehensive usage tracking system with real-time credit deduction, alongside the existing brand profile generation and video collection systems. The platform enforces credit limits, tracks detailed analytics, and provides real-time user feedback.

### **ðŸ”¥ LATEST COMPLETION: Usage Tracking System (January 2, 2025)**

- **Sidebar Footer**: Settings gear (bottom) â†’ UsageTracker â†’ User profile
- **Design Principles**: Industry-standard placement, scalable for future features

#### **Backend Architecture & Security** âœ…
**CreditsService Class Methods**:
```typescript
// Core credit operations
static async initializeUserCredits(userId: string, accountLevel: AccountLevel)
static async getUserCredits(userId: string, accountLevel: AccountLevel)
static async canPerformAction(userId: string, operation: CreditOperation, accountLevel: AccountLevel)
static async deductCredits(userId: string, operation: CreditOperation, accountLevel: AccountLevel)
static async getUsageStats(userId: string, accountLevel: AccountLevel)
static async trackUsageAndDeductCredits() // One-call operation for API routes
```

**Database Schema**:
- **user_credits**: Account balances, limits, period tracking, analytics
- **credit_transactions**: Complete audit trail with before/after balances
- **usage_tracking**: Detailed operation logs with metadata

**API Integration & Security**:
- **Speed-write API**: Credit checking before generation, deduction after success
- **Authentication Integration**: Works with existing Firebase Auth and API key systems
- **Rate Limiting**: Continues to work alongside credit enforcement
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failures with proper HTTP status codes (402 for insufficient credits)

### **ðŸ”¥ PREVIOUSLY COMPLETED: Brand Profile System (January 2, 2025)**

#### **Complete Brand Profile Generation System** âœ…
**The Achievement**: Full AI-powered brand strategy creation with personalized content pillars, keywords, and insights.
**Technical Implementation**:
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash Integration**: Reliable JSON response parsing with markdown cleanup
- **Firestore Database**: Complete CRUD operations with proper indexing
- **React Query Optimization**: Real-time UI updates with refetch strategy
- **Multi-Tab Interface**: Overview, Questions, Content Pillars, and Keywords
- **Smart Navigation**: Auto-switching with user control preservation
- **Result**: Users can generate comprehensive brand profiles with immediate UI feedback

#### **Critical Database & UI Fixes** âœ…
**Firestore Index Fix**: Added missing composite index for `userId + createdAt` queries
- **Problem**: `FAILED_PRECONDITION: The query requires an index` errors
- **Solution**: Deployed composite index to Firebase console
- **Result**: Brand profiles now load immediately after generation

**React Query Refetch Strategy**: Replaced `invalidateQueries` with `refetchQueries`
- **Problem**: Generated profiles existed in database but didn't appear in UI
- **Solution**: Added `async/await` pattern for immediate data refresh
- **Result**: UI instantly reflects generated brand profile data

**Questions Tab Clickability**: Fixed overly aggressive auto-switching
- **Problem**: Questions tab appeared unclickable after profile generation
- **Solution**: Added `hasAutoSwitched` state flag to prevent continuous auto-switching
- **Result**: Full tab navigation functionality restored

**Brand Profile Notifications**: Stopped notifications after profile completion
- **Problem**: Notifications continued showing even after profile creation
- **Solution**: Enhanced provider to check for existing profiles
- **Result**: Notifications stop immediately after profile creation

## **ðŸŽ‰ LATEST: Complete Video Collection System** (Previously Completed Dec 30, 2024)

#### **Critical RBAC Fix - Videos Now Appear in Collections** âœ…
**The Issue**: Videos were processing successfully but not appearing in collections due to missing database fields.
**Root Cause**: RBAC queries required `addedAt` timestamp field that wasn't being saved with videos.
**Solution**: 
- Added missing `addedAt` field to video save operation
- Fixed Instagram URL encoding issues with proper decoding
- Enhanced authentication to include `userId` for proper ownership
- **Result**: Videos now appear immediately in collections after processing

#### **Production-Ready Single Video Playback** âœ…
**The Issue**: Multiple videos playing simultaneously when switching between videos.
**Root Cause**: Bunny.net iframes continued playing even when "paused" via postMessage.
**Solution - Iframe Recreation Strategy**:
- Complete iframe destruction and recreation when switching videos
- `iframeKey` state forces React to unmount/remount iframes
- Conditional rendering for thumbnail vs playing states
- **Result**: Only one video plays at a time, production-tested and reliable

#### **Enhanced Script Editor - Expandable Text Feature** âœ…
**The Improvement**: Long script ideas were taking up too much space in chat interface.
**Solution**: Smart text truncation with user control.
**Implementation**:
- ExpandableText component with 3-line initial display
- "Show more/Show less" toggle with chevron icons
- Only applies to content >3 lines or >300 characters
- **Result**: Cleaner chat interface with optional expansion for long content

## **Brand Profile System Features** âœ…

- **Gemini 2.0 Flash Integration**: Reliable JSON response parsing with markdown cleanup
- **7-Question Framework**: Comprehensive brand identity questionnaire

- **User Ownership**: Proper RBAC with `userId` scoping
- **Active Profile Management**: Single active profile per user
- **Version Tracking**: Profile versioning for future enhancements

### **Real-Time UI Updates**
```typescript
// Optimized React Query pattern
const generateProfileMutation = useMutation({
  mutationFn: (questionnaire: BrandQuestionnaire) => BrandProfileService.generateBrandProfile(questionnaire),
  onSuccess: async () => {
    toast.success("Brand profile generated successfully!");
    // Force immediate refetch for instant UI updates
    await queryClient.refetchQueries({ queryKey: ["brand-profiles"] });
    // Mark onboarding complete to stop notifications
    BrandProfileService.markOnboardingComplete();
    onProfileGenerated();
  },
});
```
