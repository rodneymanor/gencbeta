## ðŸŽ‰ **MAJOR MILESTONE: Production Video Collection System** (Dec 30, 2024)

### **System Status: Fully Production Ready** âœ…
All critical video processing and playback features are now working reliably in production. The Gen C Beta application is live on Vercel with complete functionality for TikTok/Instagram video processing, collections management, and script generation.

### **ðŸ”¥ LATEST COMPLETIONS (Dec 30, 2024)**

#### **Critical RBAC Fix - Videos Now Appear in Collections** âœ…
**The Issue**: Videos were processing successfully but not appearing in collections due to missing database fields.
**Root Cause**: RBAC queries required `addedAt` timestamp field that wasn't being saved with videos.
**Solution**: 
- Added missing `addedAt` field to video save operation
- Fixed Instagram URL encoding issues with proper decoding
- Enhanced authentication to include `userId` for proper ownership
- **Result**: Videos now appear immediately in collections after processing

#### **Production-Ready Single Video Playback** âœ…
**The Issue**: Multiple videos playing simultaneously when switching between videos.
**Root Cause**: Bunny.net iframes continued playing even when "paused" via postMessage.
**Solution - Iframe Recreation Strategy**:
- Complete iframe destruction and recreation when switching videos
- `iframeKey` state forces React to unmount/remount iframes
- Conditional rendering for thumbnail vs playing states
- **Result**: Only one video plays at a time, production-tested and reliable

#### **Enhanced Script Editor - Expandable Text Feature** âœ…
**The Improvement**: Long script ideas were taking up too much space in chat interface.
**Solution**: Smart text truncation with user control.
**Implementation**:
- ExpandableText component with 3-line initial display
- "Show more/Show less" toggle with chevron icons
- Only applies to content >3 lines or >300 characters
- **Result**: Cleaner chat interface with optional expansion for long content

#### **Bunny.net Security Policy** âœ…
**The Security Enhancement**: Prevent direct social media video embedding causing CSP errors.
**Solution**: Strict URL validation in VideoEmbed component.
**Implementation**:
- Only allows `iframe.mediadelivery.net`, `bunnycdn.com`, `b-cdn.net` URLs
- Rejects all TikTok/Instagram direct URLs with user-friendly message
- **Result**: CSP compliance and secure video embedding
